# OCPP Proxy - Multi-Version EV Charger Sharing

A secure, lightweight OCPP proxy server designed as a Home Assistant add-on that enables intelligent EV charger sharing. Supports both **OCPP 1.6** and **OCPP 2.0.1** protocols with automatic version detection.

The proxy sits between a single EV charger and multiple backend services (energy providers, fleet management, charging networks), allowing multiple third-party services to use spare charger capacity while keeping the homeowner in full control.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔌 **Multi-Protocol Support**
- **OCPP 1.6** and **OCPP 2.0.1** support with automatic version detection
- WebSocket subprotocol negotiation and header-based version detection
- Unified API across both protocol versions

### 🏠 **Homeowner Control**
- User maintains full control and can override any backend at any time
- Smart arbitration with configurable rules and preferences
- Home Assistant integration for monitoring and manual overrides

### ⚡ **Intelligent Sharing**
- Single charger connection supports multiple backend subscribers
- Real-time event broadcasting to all connected services
- Automatic control arbitration with safety-first design

### 🔗 **Dual Connection Types**
- **WebSocket Backends**: Traditional services connect to the proxy
- **OCPP Service Clients**: Proxy connects outbound to OCPP services
- Both types compete for control using the same arbitration rules

### 🛡️ **Safety & Security**
- Automatic safety controls prevent conflicts and handle charger faults
- Rate limiting and provider filtering (allowlist/blocklist support)
- Charger fault detection automatically revokes backend control

### 📊 **Monitoring & Analytics**
- Session tracking with SQLite persistence
- Revenue tracking for different providers
- CSV export functionality via REST API
- Real-time status monitoring via Home Assistant

# Start development server
make run
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Basic Configuration (YAML)
```yaml
# OCPP Protocol Settings
ocpp_version: "1.6"              # Default version (1.6 or 2.0.1)
auto_detect_ocpp_version: true   # Auto-detect from connection

# Sharing Control
allow_shared_charging: true
preferred_provider: "energy_provider_1"
rate_limit_seconds: 10

# Home Assistant Integration
presence_sensor: "binary_sensor.someone_home"
override_input_boolean: "input_boolean.charger_override"

# Provider Management
allowed_providers: ["provider1", "provider2"]  # Optional allowlist
blocked_providers: ["spammer"]                 # Optional blocklist

# OCPP Services (Outbound Connections)
ocpp_services:
  - id: "energy_provider"
    url: "ws://provider.com/ocpp"
    version: "1.6"
    auth_type: "basic"
    username: "user"
    password: "pass"
    enabled: true
  
  - id: "fleet_service"
    url: "wss://fleet.com/ocpp/cp001"
    version: "2.0.1"
    auth_type: "token"
    token: "bearer_token_here"
    enabled: true
```

### Version Detection
The proxy automatically detects OCPP versions through:
- WebSocket subprotocol (`ocpp1.6`, `ocpp2.0.1`)
- HTTP headers (`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`, `X-OCPP-Version`)
- URL query parameters (`?version=2.0.1`)
- URL path patterns (`/charger/v2.0.1`)

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### WebSocket Endpoints
- **`/charger`** - EV charger connection (CSMS role)
  - Auto-detects OCPP version
  - Supports query parameters: `?version=2.0.1`
- **`/backend?id=backend_id`** - Backend service connections
  - Custom protocol for control requests and event subscriptions

### REST API
- **`GET /`** - Web interface with endpoint documentation
- **`GET /sessions`** - Charging sessions as JSON
- **`GET /sessions.csv`** - Charging sessions as CSV
- **`GET /status`** - Backend status and current control owner
- **`POST /override`** - Manual control override

- Automatic message format conversion and enum handling

### Control Flow
1. **Connection**: Charger connects → Version detected → Appropriate handler created
2. **Registration**: Multiple backends subscribe to events and request control
3. **Arbitration**: Smart control arbitration based on rules and preferences
4. **Safety**: Automatic fault handling and user override capabilities

## 📊 Use Cases

### Primary Scenario
Homeowner with EV charger wants to:
- Allow energy providers to use spare capacity during off-peak rates
- Let fleet services use charger for delivery vehicles during work hours
- Provide public access through charging networks when on vacation
- Maintain full control with Home Assistant automation

### Example Integrations
- **Energy Providers**: Smart charging during cheap electricity periods
- **Fleet Management**: Scheduled charging for commercial vehicles  
- **Charging Networks**: Revenue sharing through public access
- **Home Automation**: Presence-based blocking and smart overrides

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- **Fault Handling**: Charger faults immediately revoke all backend control
- **Conflict Prevention**: Only one backend can control charger simultaneously
- **User Override**: Always possible via Home Assistant interface
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam requests from backends
- **Provider Filtering**: Allowlist/blocklist support for security

## 📈 Future Roadmap

### OCPP 2.1 Support (2025 H2)
- Bidirectional charging (V2G) support
- Distributed Energy Resource (DER) control
- Enhanced payment integration
- Battery swapping support

### Planned Features
- Advanced pricing APIs
